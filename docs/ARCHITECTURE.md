# MessagingApp Architecture

## Overview
MessagingApp is a cross-platform messaging system built entirely on the .NET platform. The solution consists of:

- **Mobile Clients**: .NET MAUI apps for Android, iOS, and Windows.
- **Backend Services**: ASP.NET Core microservices providing authentication, messaging, media handling, and real-time communication.
- **Admin Portal**: Blazor Server application for back-office administration.

## Mobile Clients (MAUI)
- Text messaging with push notifications.
- Audio and video calls built on WebRTC or SignalR.
- File and media sharing with upload progress tracking.
- Group chats and conference calls.
- Local message persistence via SQLite.
- End-to-end encryption using a Signal Protocol library (e.g., libsignal or double ratchet implementation).

## Backend Services (ASP.NET Core)
- Authentication via phone number (OTP) or email/password, integrated with IdentityServer.
- REST/gRPC API for message routing and metadata storage. Encrypted payloads are stored opaque to the server.
- SignalR hubs for real-time presence and call signaling.
- Media service storing encrypted blobs in Azure Blob Storage or equivalent.
- Notification service integrating with FCM/APNs/Windows Push.
- EF Core with PostgreSQL for relational data.

## End-to-End Encryption
- Utilizes the Signal Protocol for key exchange, session management, and message encryption.
- Keys are generated and stored only on clients; the server acts solely as a message relay.
- Messages are encrypted client-side and decrypted on receipt; the server never sees plaintext content.

## Admin Portal (Blazor)
- User and group management dashboard.
- Usage analytics and audit logs.
- Moderation features operating only on metadata; content remains encrypted.
- Role-based access control via ASP.NET Core Identity.

## DevOps and Deployment
- Containerized services using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes or Azure Container Apps.
- CI/CD pipelines building MAUI packages and deploying backend services.
- Monitoring with Application Insights and centralized logging.
